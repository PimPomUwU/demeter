A group of seven people from different historical eras standing together against a neutral off-white studio background. Each person is in full body view, smiling naturally, dressed in clothing from their respective time periods: a young man in a beige tunic holding a wooden triangle, a Roman-inspired figure with a laurel wreath and red toga, a middle-aged man in a tunic with a purple stripe, a woman in a green ancient Greek gown with a laurel wreath (goddess Demeter), a woman in a black velvet dress holding a golden pen, a man in a dark suit holding a notebook, and a woman in a light blue vintage knee-length dress waving. Soft studio lighting, balanced composition, realistic style.


<!-- # AI Team Group Portrait

Create a group portrait of seven historical-styled AI assistants, standing side by side and smiling as they warmly welcome a newcomer. Use a clean, pure white background with no texture or shadows. Ensure soft, even lighting with realistic photographic quality, matching the original studio-style portraits provided.

Adjust the framing: allow subtle spacing between characters and from the edges of the image — do not crop them too tightly. Leave visual breathing room above their heads and on both sides to avoid a cramped composition.

From left to right:

1. A young man in beige ancient clothing, holding a wooden triangle – calm and humble expression (Quiliano).
2. A confident young man in Roman red-and-white robes with a golden laurel crown – noble and elegant (Magnus).
3. A mature man in a white Roman toga with a purple stripe – dignified and composed (Alan).
4. A Victorian woman in a black dress with lace gloves, holding a golden pen – sharp and observant (Ada).
5. A man in a dark modern suit and tie, holding a notebook – serious and focused (Leonardo).
6. A young woman in a light blue vintage dress with embroidery – expressive and kind (Eleanor).

All should be facing forward, standing as a welcoming team. Add subtle variations in pose (e.g., one hand raised, another holding an object). Their facial features must appear smooth, photorealistic and natural — avoid artificial textures or stiff expressions. Keep the entire composition balanced, clean, and professional.
