Half-length portrait of Demeter, a young goddess inspired by Demeter, the Greek goddess of agriculture: in her twenties, with a Mediterranean complexion, a natural olive tone (no yellowish highlights), and wavy light blonde hair. She wears a light green tunic, immaculate over it with a small golden brooch alluding to the countryside attached to her shoulders. She wears a delicate floral tiara on her head, and an accompanying aura of nature. Her expression: she must have a serene and confident smile; her arms relaxed at her sides.
